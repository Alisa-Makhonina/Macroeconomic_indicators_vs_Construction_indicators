    "This section builds on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) insights to develop predictive models for forecasting UK construction sector trends with macroeconomic indicators. Using identified correlations and time-lags, we implement lagged regression and Vector Autoregression (VAR) models to capture the dynamic relationships between variables like GDP, inflation, and construction output, material prices, and new contracts. The models account for black swan events (e.g., 2008 crisis, Brexit, COVID-19) via dummy variables, aiming to provide accurate forecasts and address the research questions on predictive power and lagged effects."

Using the Engle-Granger method on I(1) series, several variable pairs were found to be cointegrated, indicating they move together over time despite short-term fluctuations. These cointegrated pairs are suitable candidates for further modeling using Vector Error Correction Models (VECM). Non-cointegrated pairs, by contrast, do not share a stable long-run relationship and should be analyzed with caution in trend-based modeling."
